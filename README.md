# Dice Game

> Based on [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) JS Course

One of the more complex and unique games I've seen in a course.

## How does it work?

- 2 people play the game.
- You roll the dice.
- You get 1 - You lose it all
  - You get any other number - You can choose to risk it for more, or keep your score
- First person to reach 100 wins.
